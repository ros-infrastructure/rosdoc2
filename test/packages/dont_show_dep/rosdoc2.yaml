settings:
    ## If this is true, a standard index page is generated in the output directory.
    ## It uses the package information from the 'package.xml' to show details
    ## about the package, creates a table of contents for the various builders
    ## that were run, and may contain links to things like build farm jobs for
    ## this package or links to other versions of this package.

    ## If false, you can still include content that would have been in the index
    ## into one of your '.rst' files from your Sphinx project, using the
    ## '.. include::' directive in Sphinx.
    ## For example, you could include it in a custom 'index.rst' so you can have
    ## the standard information followed by custom content.

    ## TODO(wjwwood): provide a concrete example of this (relative path?)

    ## If this is not specified explicitly, it defaults to 'true'.
    generate_package_index: true

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user would like to generate C/C++ API documentation for a package that is not
    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.
    always_run_doxygen: false

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `sphinx-apidoc` regardless of build
    ## type. This is most useful if the user would like to generate Python API
    ## documentation for a package that is not of the `ament_python` build type.
    always_run_sphinx_apidoc: false

    # This setting, if provided, will override the build_type of this package
    # for documentation purposes only. If not provided, documentation will be
    # generated assuming the build_type in package.xml.
    # override_build_type: 'ament_python'

    # This boolean setting, if provided, determines whether the external dependencies of a package
    # are shown in the home page of the documentation, which is useful for packages that are only
    # used to force loading of other packages (which are sometimes called meta packages).
    # If not set, then the decision to show the external dependencies is made on the following
    # heuristics: show if the package has no build_depend, does have exec_depend, and has no
    # subdirectories except an optional doc/ subdirectory.
    show_exec_dep: false
builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Required keys in the settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.
