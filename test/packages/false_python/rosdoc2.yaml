    ## This setting is relevant mostly if the standard Python package layout cannot
    ## be assumed for 'sphinx-apidoc' invocation. The user can provide the path

    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Keys in all settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.
