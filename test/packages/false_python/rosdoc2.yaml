    ## This setting is relevant mostly if the standard Python package layout cannot
    ## be assumed for 'sphinx-apidoc' invocation. The user can provide the path
    ## (relative to the 'package.xml' file) where the Python modules defined by this
    ## package are located.

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user would like to generate C/C++ API documentation for a package that is not
    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.

    ## documentation for a package that is not of the `ament_python` build type.

    ## for documentation purposes only. If not provided, documentation will be
    ## generated assuming the build_type in package.xml.

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Keys in all settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.

        # name: 'false_python Public C/C++ API',
        # output_dir: 'generated/doxygen',

        # doxyfile: null,
        ## additional statements to add to the Doxyfile, list of strings

        ## If sphinx_sourcedir is specified and not null, then the documentation in that folder
        ## (specified relative to the package.xml directory) will replace rosdoc2's normal output.
        ## If sphinx_sourcedir is left unspecified, any documentation found in the doc/ or
        ## doc/source/ folder will still be included by default, along with other relevant package
        ## information.
        # sphinx_sourcedir: null,
        ## Directory (relative to the package.xml directory) where user documentation is found. If
        ## documentation is in one of the standard locations (doc/ or doc/source) this is not
        ## needed. Unlike sphinx_sourcedir, specifying this does not override the standard rosdoc2
        ## output, but includes this user documentation along with other items included by default
        ## by rosdoc2.
