# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# rosdoc2 runs sphinx in wrapping directory so that output does not contaminate
# the source repository. But that can make figuring out the proper path to
# python files tricky in conf.py. Normally you do not have to set this in a custom
# conf.py, as the proper directory is set in the a wrapping conf.py (based on the project's
# 'python_src_directory' which by default is the package name). If for some reason you must
# set a path there, as an example where your directory structure is:
#
#   some_package_name/
#     package.xml
#     doc/
#       conf.py
#     some_package_name/
#       some_python_file.py
#
#  then the correct entry for sys.path would be:
#
#import os
#import sys
#sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..', '..', '..', 'some_package_name)))

# Note we no longer have to adjust the sys.path in custom conf.py.

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

version = '0.0'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
## rosdoc2 will extend the extensions to enable Breathe and Exhale if you
## do not add them here, as well as others, perhaps.
## If you add them manually rosdoc2 may still try to configure them.

# This tests inclusion of non-default extensions, since 'allow_other_extensions' = True
extensions = ['sphinx_prompt']

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
## rosdoc2 will override the theme, but you may set one here for running Sphinx
## without the rosdoc2 tool.

# This tests using a different theme, since 'override_theme' = False.  Note we don't
# have to install the extension in Sphinx for the theme to be found.

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
## rosdoc2 comments this out by default because we're not creating it.
# html_static_path = ['_static']

# -- Options for rosdoc2 -----------------------------------------------------

## These settings are specific to rosdoc2, and if Sphinx is run without rosdoc2
## they will be safely ignored.

## therefore you will need to uncomment the lines and change their value
## if you want change the behavior of rosdoc2.

    ## This setting, if True, will ensure breathe is part of the 'extensions',

    # 'enable_breathe': True,

    ## This setting, if True, will ensure exhale is part of the 'extensions',
    ## and will set all of the exhale configurations, if not set, and override
    ## settings as needed if they are set by this configuration.
    # 'enable_exhale': True,

    ## This setting, if provided, allows option specification for breathe
    ## directives through exhale. If not set, exhale defaults will be used.
    ## If an empty dictionary is provided, breathe defaults will be used.

    ## This setting, if True, will have the 'html_theme' overridden to provide
    ## a consistent style across all of the ROS documentation.
    'override_theme': False,

    ## This setting, if True, will automatically extend the intersphinx mapping
    ## using inventory files found in the cross-reference directory.
    ## If false, the `found_intersphinx_mappings` variable will be in the global
    ## scope when run with rosdoc2, and could be conditionally used in your own
    ## Sphinx conf.py file.

    # 'support_markdown': True,
